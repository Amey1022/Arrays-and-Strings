# Arrays-and-Strings
<h2>Overview</h2>
This repository contains experiments designed to help understand arrays and strings in C++. The exercises focus on the fundamental operations, including traversal, manipulation, and basic algorithmic applications.

<h2>Content</h2>
<h3>Arrays in C++ Concepts Covered:</h3>
Memory allocation for arrays
Operations like traversal, insertion, deletion, and searching
<H3>Key Operations:</H3>

Array traversal
Reversing an array Finding minimum and maximum values
Calculating sum and average of elements

<h2>Strings in C++</h2>
<h3>Concepts Covered:</h3>
String manipulation techniques
Common operations such as concatenation, substring extraction, and comparison
<h3>Key Operations:</h3>

String reversal
Checking for palindromes
Concatenating strings
Each experiment aims to deepen the understanding of these core data structures in C++ through practical coding examples and exercises.
